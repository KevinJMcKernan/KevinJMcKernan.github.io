			<h1>About</h1>
      <p> Born and raised in the Tampa Bay Area. I graduated from the University of Florida with a Bachelor of Science in <b>Microbiology and Cellular Science</b>. While having fun culturing Nitrogen Fixing Bacteria and creating recombiant protiens I had the privilege of taking a Bioinformatics class taught in Python just pior to graduation. <em>Leading too. . . </em><p>

      A Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering from the University of South Florida. I enjoyed my classwork in Algorithms, Operating Systems, OO Design, Computer Architecture and Design, CMOS-VLSI, FPGA, AI and more! While proudly serving as member and then president of USF branch of ACM. 
</p>
<p>
      During my time at USF I had the great opportunity to complete two internships. My first internship with Star2Star Communications, a internet telecommunications company, introduced me to large software projects and unit testing. My second internship with JP Morgan Chase as part of their Technology Analyst Program (TAP) introduced me to the MEAN software stack and my first taste of true fullstack development.  
</p>
<p>

      After graduation I immediately started work at Raymond James Financial in the Advanced Development Program (ADP) 2017 cohort in the Anti-Money Laundering (AML) group. My work at Raymond James as part of the AML group exposed me to a variety of software languages and platforms! On the data side I have had the privilege of working with SQL Server and Oracle databases in SSMS and SQL Developer. On the backend side I have worked on multiple batch applications for processing regulatory and firm requirements. On the fullstack side of the house I have worked with ASP.NET and Angular 5 using mixed SQL Server and Oracle datasources.  
<p>

      While not coding I enjoy running, fishing, woodworking and electronics projects.
